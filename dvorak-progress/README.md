# Dvorak progress
The Dvorak keyboard layout is an alternative to qwerty, the standard layout in nearly everyone uses. However, qwerty is far from optimal.

People that type a lot, everyday, sometimes begin to suffer from wrist strain. Dvorak is a keyboard layout that aims to solve this, as it places common keys on the home row, and optimizes the layout in a way that alternates keypresses between fingers.

I recently gained the motivation to learn the Dvorak layout myself, and thought it would be fun to track my progress, thus I'm aiming to practice everyday using 10fastfingers.com, and log my best speed for the day.
I aim to track my progress until I'm back at my speed with qwerty, which is around 80 wpm.
