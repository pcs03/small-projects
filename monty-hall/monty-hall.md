# Monty Hall Problem Simulation

The monty hall problem goes like this:

A game show host shows you three doors. Two of the doors has a goat behind it, one door has a brand spanking new super car behind it.

The host instructs you to choose one of the doors, after you have chosen a door, he walks up to one of the other doors and opens it. The door the host opens has a goat behind it, he now walks up to you and asks you the question: "Do you want to switch doors?".

Now, most people would think this is now a fifty-fifty scenario, and would hesitate to switch out of fear and paranoia. However, statistically thinking, this is not a fifty-fifty scenario. Switching would gain you the edge here, you would go from a 33.3% chance of winning, to 66.7%. 

The monty-hall problem is a well known problem among statisticians, and has sparked much debate over course of time. Since this problem can be difficult to wrap your head around, I decided to try and simulate the monty hall problem. The Python file has some code to simulate the problem 1000000 times in a row. The simulation confirms the fact that switching would give you the edge. Without switching, the player wins approx. 33.3% of the time. After switching, the player's wins would indeed increase to approx. 66.7%.
